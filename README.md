This project performs sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using text classification. The data is processed with a Bag-of-Words representation, removing very frequent and rare words, and selecting features based on Information Gain. 
A Naive Bayes classifier is implemented from scratch and compared to scikit-learnâ€™s Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and MLP classifiers. The code evaluates each model with precision, recall, and F1-score, and visualizes learning curves.
Libraries used include TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The main goal is to compare simple and more complex classifiers on a text classification task in a clear and educational way.
